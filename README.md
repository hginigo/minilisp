# minilisp
The goal for this application is to implement a working lisp interpreter from scratch. For now, I
am working on the parser.

## Building
### Tools needed
- The rust compiler (`rustc`)
- Cargo

You can find these tools [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The application should be buildable at any point of the developement at the `master` branch, 
although for the moment it does nothing but passing tests.

### Cargo dependencies
By the time, this project does not require any extra dependencies.

### To build and run it
```console
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```
